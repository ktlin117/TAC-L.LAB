# TAC-L.LAB
You play as a cat named Ball Cat dressed in a lab coat in a giant ball. The ball the cat is in rolls around and has a hook shot that shoots out of it. When the hook shot latches onto something, the cat can swing around it as a pivot. Using this mechanic, the player is to traverse levels with obstacles and reach the end.
